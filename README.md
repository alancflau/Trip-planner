# Trip planner

Do you love travelling? Do you procrastinate while scheduling your travel plans? This trip planner may be a great scheduling device for you to plan your trip.

<h3> How it works </h3>

<h4> Part 1: Retrieving data </h4>
We will be retrieving data from [google travel](https://www.google.com/travel/). The driver.py module already provides the implementation of web scraping. The function inside the module, google_search, takes in one parameter that takes in a location. When calling the module, the user will call this function and enter a city location they are interested in going as one of the parameters. </br>

The script will retrieve data of the user's city attractions, ratings, categories, reviews, and a mini description of the attraction.

Using Selenium, Selenium requires a driver to interface with the chosen browser. The chosen browser is based on a person's preference. For more information how installation drivers, please visit this [link](https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/installation.html).
